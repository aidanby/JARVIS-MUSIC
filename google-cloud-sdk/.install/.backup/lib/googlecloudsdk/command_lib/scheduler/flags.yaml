args:
- api_field: job.schedule
  arg_name: schedule
  required: true
  help_text: |
    Schedule on which the job will be executed.

    As a general rule, execution `n + 1` of a job will not begin until
    execution `n` has finished. Cloud Scheduler will never allow two
    simultaneously outstanding executions. For example, this implies that if
    the `n+1` execution is scheduled to run at `16:00` but the `n`
    execution takes until `16:15`, the `n+1` execution will not start
    until `16:15`. A scheduled start time will be delayed if the previous
    execution has not ended when its scheduled time occurs.

    If --retry-count > 0 and a job attempt fails, the job will be tried a
    total of --retry-count times, with exponential backoff, until the next
    scheduled start time.

    The schedule can be either of the following types:
    * Crontab: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Overview
    * English-like schedule: https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/quickstart#defining_the_job_schedule
- api_field: job.timeZone
  arg_name: time-zone
  default: Etc/UTC
  help_text: |
    Specifies the time zone to be used in interpreting --schedule. The value
    of this field must be a time zone name from the tz database
    (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database).

    Note that some time zones include a provision for
    daylight savings time. The rules for daylight saving time are
    determined by the chosen time zone.

    For UTC use the string "utc". Default is "utc".
- api_field: job.description
  arg_name: description
  help_text: |
    Human-readable description of the job.
retry_args:
- api_field: job.retryConfig.retryCount
  arg_name: max-retry-attempts
  default: 0
  help_text: |
        Number of times to retry the request if it fails or times out. Must
        be in range 0-5 inclusive. Default is 0.
- api_field: job.retryConfig.maxRetryDuration
  arg_name: max-retry-duration
  type: googlecloudsdk.core.util.times:ParseDuration
  processor: googlecloudsdk.core.util.times:FormatDurationForJson
  help_text: |
    Time limit for retrying a failed task, measured from when the task was
    first run. If specified with `--max-retry-attempts` greater than 0, the
    task will be retried until both limits are reached. Default is 0 (which
    means unlimited).
- api_field: job.retryConfig.minBackoffDuration
  arg_name: min-backoff
  type: googlecloudsdk.core.util.times:ParseDuration
  processor: googlecloudsdk.core.util.times:FormatDurationForJson
  default: 5s
  help_text: |
    Minimum amount of time to wait before retrying a task after it
    fails. For example, `10s`. Default is `5s`.
- api_field: job.retryConfig.maxBackoffDuration
  arg_name: max-backoff
  default: 1h
  type: googlecloudsdk.core.util.times:ParseDuration
  processor: googlecloudsdk.core.util.times:FormatDurationForJson
  help_text: |
    Maximum amount of time to wait before retrying a task after it
    fails. For example, `10m`. Default is `1h`.
- api_field: job.retryConfig.maxDoublings
  arg_name: max-doublings
  default: 16
  help_text: |
    Maximum number of times that the interval between failed job
    retries will be doubled before the increase becomes constant.
