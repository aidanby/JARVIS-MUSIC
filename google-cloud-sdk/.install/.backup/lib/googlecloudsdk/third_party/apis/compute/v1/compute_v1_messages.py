      with any external load balancer. Regional forwarding rules in Premium
      Tier can only be used with a Network load balancer.  If this field is
      not specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM.
    PurposeValueValuesEnum: The purpose of resource, only used with INTERNAL
      type.
    StatusValueValuesEnum: [Output Only] The status of the address, which can
      be one of RESERVING, RESERVED, or IN_USE. An address that is RESERVING
      is currently in the process of being reserved. A RESERVED address is
      currently reserved and available to use. An IN_USE address is currently
      being used by another resource and is not available.

  Fields:
    address: The static IP address represented by this resource.
    addressType: The type of address to reserve, either INTERNAL or EXTERNAL.
      If unspecified, defaults to EXTERNAL.
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    ipVersion: The IP Version that will be used by this address. Valid options
      are IPV4 or IPV6. This can only be specified for a global address.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#address for
      addresses.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    network: The URL of the network in which to reserve the address. This
      field can only be used with INTERNAL type with VPC_PEERING purpose.
    networkTier: This signifies the networking tier used for configuring this
      Address and can only take the following values: PREMIUM, STANDARD.
      Global forwarding rules can only be Premium Tier. Regional forwarding
      rules can be either Premium or Standard Tier. Standard Tier addresses
      applied to regional forwarding rules can be used with any external load
      balancer. Regional forwarding rules in Premium Tier can only be used
      with a Network load balancer.  If this field is not specified, it is
      assumed to be PREMIUM.
    prefixLength: The prefix length if the resource reprensents an IP range.
    purpose: The purpose of resource, only used with INTERNAL type.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional address
      resides. This field is not applicable to global addresses. You must
      specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. You cannot set this
      field in the request body.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    status: [Output Only] The status of the address, which can be one of
      RESERVING, RESERVED, or IN_USE. An address that is RESERVING is
      currently in the process of being reserved. A RESERVED address is
      currently reserved and available to use. An IN_USE address is currently
      being used by another resource and is not available.
    subnetwork: The URL of the subnetwork in which to reserve the address. If
      an IP address is specified, it must be within the subnetwork's IP range.
      This field can only be used with INTERNAL type with
      GCE_ENDPOINT/DNS_RESOLVER purposes.
    users: [Output Only] The URLs of the resources that are using this
      address.

  Enums:
    InterfaceValueValuesEnum: Specifies the disk interface to use for

      Persistent disks must always use SCSI and the request will fail if you
      attempt to attach a persistent disk in any other format than SCSI. Local
      SSDs can use either NVME or SCSI. For performance characteristics of
      SCSI over NVMe, see Local SSD performance.
    ModeValueValuesEnum: The mode in which to attach this disk, either
      READ_WRITE or READ_ONLY. If not specified, the default is to attach the
      disk in READ_WRITE mode.
    TypeValueValuesEnum: Specifies the type of the disk, either SCRATCH or
      PERSISTENT. If not specified, the default is PERSISTENT.

  Fields:
    autoDelete: Specifies whether the disk will be auto-deleted when the
      instance is deleted (but not when the disk is detached from the
      instance).
    boot: Indicates that this is a boot disk. The virtual machine will use the
      first partition of the disk for its root filesystem.
    deviceName: Specifies a unique device name of your choice that is
      reflected into the /dev/disk/by-id/google-* tree of a Linux operating
      system running within the instance. This name can be used to reference
      the device for mounting, resizing, and so on, from within the instance.
      If not specified, the server chooses a default device name to apply to
      this disk, in the form persistent-disk-x, where x is a number assigned
      by Google Compute Engine. This field is only applicable for persistent
      disks.
    diskEncryptionKey: Encrypts or decrypts a disk using a customer-supplied
      encryption key.  If you are creating a new disk, this field encrypts the
      new disk using an encryption key that you provide. If you are attaching
      an existing disk that is already encrypted, this field decrypts the disk
      using the customer-supplied encryption key.  If you encrypt a disk using
      a customer-supplied key, you must provide the same key again when you
      attempt to use this resource at a later time. For example, you must
      provide the key when you create a snapshot or an image from the disk or
      when you attach the disk to a virtual machine instance.  If you do not
      provide an encryption key, then the disk will be encrypted using an
      automatically generated key and you do not need to provide a key to use
      the disk later.  Instance templates do not store customer-supplied
      encryption keys, so you cannot use your own keys to encrypt disks in a
      managed instance group.
    guestOsFeatures: A list of features to enable on the guest operating
      system. Applicable only for bootable images. Read  Enabling guest
      operating system features to see a list of available options.
    index: [Output Only] A zero-based index to this disk, where 0 is reserved
      for the boot disk. If you have many disks attached to an instance, each
      disk would have a unique index number.
    initializeParams: [Input Only] Specifies the parameters for a new disk
      that will be created alongside the new instance. Use initialization
      parameters to create boot disks or local SSDs attached to the new
      instance.  This property is mutually exclusive with the source property;
      you can only define one or the other, but not both.
    interface: Specifies the disk interface to use for attaching this disk,
      which is either SCSI or NVME. The default is SCSI. Persistent disks must
      always use SCSI and the request will fail if you attempt to attach a
      persistent disk in any other format than SCSI. Local SSDs can use either
      NVME or SCSI. For performance characteristics of SCSI over NVMe, see
      Local SSD performance.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#attachedDisk for
      attached disks.
    licenses: [Output Only] Any valid publicly visible licenses.
    mode: The mode in which to attach this disk, either READ_WRITE or
      READ_ONLY. If not specified, the default is to attach the disk in
      READ_WRITE mode.
    source: Specifies a valid partial or full URL to an existing Persistent
      Disk resource. When creating a new instance, one of
      initializeParams.sourceImage or disks.source is required except for
      local SSD.  If desired, you can also attach existing non-root persistent
      disks using this property. This field is only applicable for persistent
      disks.  Note that for InstanceTemplate, specify the disk name, not the

      projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-9   Alternatively, use
      a specific version of a public operating system image: projects/debian-
      cloud/global/images/debian-9-stretch-vYYYYMMDD   To create a disk with a
      custom image that you created, specify the image name in the following

    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    port: Deprecated in favor of portName. The TCP port to connect on the
      backend. The default value is 80.  This cannot be used for internal load
      balancing.
    portName: Name of backend port. The same name should appear in the
      instance groups referenced by this service. Required when the load
      balancing scheme is EXTERNAL.  When the load balancing scheme is
      INTERNAL, this field is not used.
    protocol: The protocol this BackendService uses to communicate with
      backends.  Possible values are HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and SSL. The default is
      HTTP.  For internal load balancing, the possible values are TCP and UDP,
      and the default is TCP.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional backend service
      resides. This field is not applicable to global backend services. You

      For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource

      expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart
      = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is
      an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions
      explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform
      = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults,
      Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next
      page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to
      500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
      creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result
      first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest
      operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or
      creationTimestamp desc is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the
      nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page

      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and

      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either

      For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to

    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine
      instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by
      specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields.
      For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart
      = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is
      an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions
      explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform
      = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults,
      Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next
      page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to
      500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
      creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result
      first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest
      operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or
      creationTimestamp desc is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the
      nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.

      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either

      For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to

      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine
      instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by
      specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields.
      For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart
      = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is
      an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions
      explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform
      = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults,
      Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next
      page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to
      500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
      creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result
      first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest
      operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or
      creationTimestamp desc is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the
      nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.

      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine

      For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine
      instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by
      specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields.
      For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart
      = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is
      an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions
      explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform
      = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be

      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
      creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine
      instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by
      specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields.
      For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart
      = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is
      an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions
      explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform
      = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults,
      Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next
      page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to
      500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
      creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result
      first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest
      operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or
      creationTimestamp desc is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine
      instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by
      specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields.
      For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart
      = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is
      an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions
      explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform
      = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults,
      Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next
      page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to
      500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
      creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result
      first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest
      operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or
      creationTimestamp desc is supported.

      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either

      specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields.
      For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart

      =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine
      instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by
      specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields.
      For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart
      = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is
      an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions
      explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform
      = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults,
      Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next
      page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to
      500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
      creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result
      first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest
      operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or
      creationTimestamp desc is supported.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine
      instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by
      specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields.
      For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart
      = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is
      an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions
      explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform
      = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults,
      Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next
      page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to
      500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
      creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result
      first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest
      operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or
      creationTimestamp desc is supported.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine
      instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by
      specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields.
      For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine
      instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by
      specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields.
      For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart

      instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by
      specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields.
      For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart
      = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is
      an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions
      explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform
      = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults,
      Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next
      page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to
      500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
      creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result
      first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest
      operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or
      creationTimestamp desc is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the
      nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.

    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#disk for disks.
    labelFingerprint: A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this disk,
      which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for optimistic
      locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and
      changes after every request to modify or update labels. You must always

      to this disk.
    licenses: A list of publicly visible licenses. Reserved for Google's use.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    options: Internal use only.
    physicalBlockSizeBytes: Physical block size of the persistent disk, in
      bytes. If not present in a request, a default value is used. Currently
      supported sizes are 4096 and 16384, other sizes may be added in the
      future. If an unsupported value is requested, the error message will
      list the supported values for the caller's project.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the disk resides. Only
      applicable for regional resources. You must specify this field as part
      of the HTTP request URL. It is not settable as a field in the request
      body.
    replicaZones: URLs of the zones where the disk should be replicated to.
      Only applicable for regional resources.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined fully-qualified URL for this
      resource.
    sizeGb: Size of the persistent disk, specified in GB. You can specify this
      field when creating a persistent disk using the sourceImage or
      sourceSnapshot parameter, or specify it alone to create an empty
      persistent disk.  If you specify this field along with sourceImage or
      sourceSnapshot, the value of sizeGb must not be less than the size of
      the sourceImage or the size of the snapshot. Acceptable values are 1 to
      65536, inclusive.
    sourceImage: The source image used to create this disk. If the source
      image is deleted, this field will not be set.  To create a disk with one
      of the public operating system images, specify the image by its family
      name. For example, specify family/debian-9 to use the latest Debian 9
      image: projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-9
      Alternatively, use a specific version of a public operating system
      image: projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-9-stretch-vYYYYMMDD
      To create a disk with a custom image that you created, specify the image
      name in the following format: global/images/my-custom-image   You can
      also specify a custom image by its image family, which returns the
      latest version of the image in that family. Replace the image name with
      family/family-name: global/images/family/my-image-family
    sourceImageEncryptionKey: The customer-supplied encryption key of the
      source image. Required if the source image is protected by a customer-
      supplied encryption key.
    sourceImageId: [Output Only] The ID value of the image used to create this
      disk. This value identifies the exact image that was used to create this
      persistent disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from an

      specifies a protocol and port-range tuple that describes a denied
      connection.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    destinationRanges: If destination ranges are specified, the firewall will
      apply only to traffic that has destination IP address in these ranges.
      These ranges must be expressed in CIDR format. Only IPv4 is supported.
    direction: Direction of traffic to which this firewall applies; default is
      INGRESS. Note: For INGRESS traffic, it is NOT supported to specify
      destinationRanges; For EGRESS traffic, it is NOT supported to specify
      sourceRanges OR sourceTags.
    disabled: Denotes whether the firewall rule is disabled, i.e not applied
      to the network it is associated with. When set to true, the firewall
      rule is not enforced and the network behaves as if it did not exist. If
      this is unspecified, the firewall rule will be enabled.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#firewall for
      firewall rules.
    logConfig: This field denotes the logging options for a particular
      firewall rule. If logging is enabled, logs will be exported to
      Stackdriver.
    name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    network: URL of the network resource for this firewall rule. If not
      specified when creating a firewall rule, the default network is used:
      global/networks/default If you choose to specify this property, you can
      specify the network as a full or partial URL. For example, the following
      are all valid URLs:   -
      https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/networks
      /my-network  - projects/myproject/global/networks/my-network  -
      global/networks/default
    priority: Priority for this rule. This is an integer between 0 and 65535,
      both inclusive. When not specified, the value assumed is 1000. Relative
      priorities determine precedence of conflicting rules. Lower value of
      priority implies higher precedence (eg, a rule with priority 0 has
      higher precedence than a rule with priority 1). DENY rules take
      precedence over ALLOW rules having equal priority.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    sourceRanges: If source ranges are specified, the firewall will apply only
      to traffic that has source IP address in these ranges. These ranges must
      be expressed in CIDR format. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags
      may be set. If both properties are set, the firewall will apply to
      traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP
      that belongs to a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The connection
      does not need to match both properties for the firewall to apply. Only
      IPv4 is supported.
    sourceServiceAccounts: If source service accounts are specified, the
      firewall will apply only to traffic originating from an instance with a
      service account in this list. Source service accounts cannot be used to
      control traffic to an instance's external IP address because service
      accounts are associated with an instance, not an IP address.
      sourceRanges can be set at the same time as sourceServiceAccounts. If
      both are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has source IP
      address within sourceRanges OR the source IP belongs to an instance with
      service account listed in sourceServiceAccount. The connection does not
      need to match both properties for the firewall to apply.
      sourceServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as sourceTags or
      targetTags.
    sourceTags: If source tags are specified, the firewall rule applies only
      to traffic with source IPs that match the primary network interfaces of
      VM instances that have the tag and are in the same VPC network. Source
      tags cannot be used to control traffic to an instance's external IP
      address, it only applies to traffic between instances in the same
      virtual network. Because tags are associated with instances, not IP
      addresses. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If
      both properties are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has
      source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP that belongs to a
      tag listed in the sourceTags property. The connection does not need to
      match both properties for the firewall to apply.
    targetServiceAccounts: A list of service accounts indicating sets of
      instances located in the network that may make network connections as
      specified in allowed[]. targetServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same
      time as targetTags or sourceTags. If neither targetServiceAccounts nor
      targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on
      the specified network.
    targetTags: A list of tags that controls which instances the firewall rule
      applies to. If targetTags are specified, then the firewall rule applies
      only to instances in the VPC network that have one of those tags. If no
      targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on
      the specified network.

  Fields:
    IPAddress: The IP address that this forwarding rule is serving on behalf
      of.  Addresses are restricted based on the forwarding rule's load
      balancing scheme (EXTERNAL or INTERNAL) and scope (global or regional).
      When the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, for global forwarding rules,
      the address must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding rules, the
      address must live in the same region as the forwarding rule. If this
      field is empty, an ephemeral IPv4 address from the same scope (global or

      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    network: This field is not used for external load balancing.  For INTERNAL

    portRange: This field is used along with the target field for
      TargetHttpProxy, TargetHttpsProxy, TargetSslProxy, TargetTcpProxy,
      TargetVpnGateway, TargetPool, TargetInstance.  Applicable only when
      IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP, only packets addressed to ports in the
      specified range will be forwarded to target. Forwarding rules with the
      same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have disjoint port ranges.  Some
      types of forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable ports:   -
      TargetHttpProxy: 80, 8080  - TargetHttpsProxy: 443  - TargetTcpProxy:
      25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995, 1688, 1883, 5222  -

      1688, 1883, 5222  - TargetVpnGateway: 500, 4500
    ports: This field is used along with the backend_service field for
      internal load balancing.  When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, a
      list of ports can be configured, for example, ['80'], ['8000','9000']
      etc. Only packets addressed to these ports will be forwarded to the
      backends configured with this forwarding rule.  You may specify a
      maximum of up to 5 ports.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional forwarding rule
      resides. This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules. You
      must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not
      settable as a field in the request body.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    serviceLabel: An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding
      Rule. If specified, will be the first label of the fully qualified
      service name.  The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
      RFC1035. Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match
      the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
      first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters
      must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character,
      which cannot be a dash.  This field is only used for internal load
      balancing.
    serviceName: [Output Only] The internal fully qualified service name for
      this Forwarding Rule.  This field is only used for internal load
      balancing.
    subnetwork: This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.  For
      internal load balancing, this field identifies the subnetwork that the
      load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule.  If the
      network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is optional.
      However, if the network is in custom subnet mode, a subnetwork must be
      specified.
    target: The URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic. For
      regional forwarding rules, this target must live in the same region as
      the forwarding rule. For global forwarding rules, this target must be a

      SUSPENDING, SUSPENDED, and TERMINATED.

  Messages:
    LabelsValue: Labels to apply to this instance. These can be later modified
      by the setLabels method.

  Fields:
    canIpForward: Allows this instance to send and receive packets with non-
      matching destination or source IPs. This is required if you plan to use
      this instance to forward routes. For more information, see Enabling IP
      Forwarding.
    cpuPlatform: [Output Only] The CPU platform used by this instance.
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    deletionProtection: Whether the resource should be protected against
      deletion.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    disks: Array of disks associated with this instance. Persistent disks must
      be created before you can assign them.
    guestAccelerators: A list of the type and count of accelerator cards
      attached to the instance.
    hostname: A string attribute.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#instance for
      instances.
    labelFingerprint: A fingerprint for this request, which is essentially a
      hash of the label's contents and used for optimistic locking. The
      fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after
      every request to modify or update labels. You must always provide an up-
      to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change labels.  To see
      the latest fingerprint, make get() request to the instance.
    labels: Labels to apply to this instance. These can be later modified by
      the setLabels method.
    machineType: Full or partial URL of the machine type resource to use for
      this instance, in the format: zones/zone/machineTypes/machine-type. This
      is provided by the client when the instance is created. For example, the
      following is a valid partial url to a predefined machine type: zones/us-
      central1-f/machineTypes/n1-standard-1   To create a custom machine type,
      provide a URL to a machine type in the following format, where CPUS is 1
      or an even number up to 32 (2, 4, 6, ... 24, etc), and MEMORY is the
      total memory for this instance. Memory must be a multiple of 256 MB and
      must be supplied in MB (e.g. 5 GB of memory is 5120 MB):
      zones/zone/machineTypes/custom-CPUS-MEMORY   For example: zones/us-
      central1-f/machineTypes/custom-4-5120   For a full list of restrictions,
      read the Specifications for custom machine types.
    metadata: The metadata key/value pairs assigned to this instance. This
      includes custom metadata and predefined keys.
    minCpuPlatform: Specifies a minimum CPU platform for the VM instance.
      Applicable values are the friendly names of CPU platforms, such as
      minCpuPlatform: "Intel Haswell" or minCpuPlatform: "Intel Sandy Bridge".
    name: The name of the resource, provided by the client when initially
      creating the resource. The resource name must be 1-63 characters long,
      and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters
      long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which
      means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
      characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
      character, which cannot be a dash.
    networkInterfaces: An array of network configurations for this instance.
      These specify how interfaces are configured to interact with other
      network services, such as connecting to the internet. Multiple
      interfaces are supported per instance.
    scheduling: Sets the scheduling options for this instance.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource.
    serviceAccounts: A list of service accounts, with their specified scopes,
      authorized for this instance. Only one service account per VM instance
      is supported.  Service accounts generate access tokens that can be
      accessed through the metadata server and used to authenticate
      applications on the instance. See Service Accounts for more information.
    startRestricted: [Output Only] Whether a VM has been restricted for start
      because Compute Engine has detected suspicious activity.
    status: [Output Only] The status of the instance. One of the following
      values: PROVISIONING, STAGING, RUNNING, STOPPING, STOPPED, SUSPENDING,
      SUSPENDED, and TERMINATED.
    statusMessage: [Output Only] An optional, human-readable explanation of
      the status.
    tags: Tags to apply to this instance. Tags are used to identify valid
      sources or targets for network firewalls and are specified by the client
      during instance creation. The tags can be later modified by the setTags
      method. Each tag within the list must comply with RFC1035. Multiple tags
      can be specified via the 'tags.items' field.
    zone: [Output Only] URL of the zone where the instance resides. You must
      specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not settable
      as a field in the request body.

      accessConfigs specified, then this instance will have no external
      internet access.
    aliasIpRanges: An array of alias IP ranges for this network interface. Can
      only be specified for network interfaces on subnet-mode networks.
    fingerprint: Fingerprint hash of contents stored in this network
      interface. This field will be ignored when inserting an Instance or
      adding a NetworkInterface. An up-to-date fingerprint must be provided in
      order to update the NetworkInterface, otherwise the request will fail
      with error 412 conditionNotMet.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#networkInterface
      for network interfaces.
    name: [Output Only] The name of the network interface, generated by the
      server. For network devices, these are eth0, eth1, etc.
    network: URL of the network resource for this instance. When creating an
      instance, if neither the network nor the subnetwork is specified, the
      default network global/networks/default is used; if the network is not
      specified but the subnetwork is specified, the network is inferred.
      This field is optional when creating a firewall rule. If not specified
      when creating a firewall rule, the default network
      global/networks/default is used.  If you specify this property, you can
      specify the network as a full or partial URL. For example, the following
      are all valid URLs:   - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/p
      roject/global/networks/network  -
      projects/project/global/networks/network  - global/networks/default
    networkIP: An IPv4 internal network address to assign to the instance for
      this network interface. If not specified by the user, an unused internal
      IP is assigned by the system.
    subnetwork: The URL of the Subnetwork resource for this instance. If the
      network resource is in legacy mode, do not provide this property. If the
      network is in auto subnet mode, providing the subnetwork is optional. If
      the network is in custom subnet mode, then this field should be

  domains, and service accounts. A `role` is a named list of permissions

      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
