    condition: Unimplemented. The condition that is associated with this

      current binding. Different bindings, including their conditions, are
      examined independently.
    members: Specifies the identities requesting access for a Cloud Platform
      resource. `members` can have the following values:  * `allUsers`: A
      special identifier that represents anyone who is    on the internet;
      with or without a Google account.  * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special
      identifier that represents anyone    who is authenticated with a Google

      represents a specific Google    account. For example, `alice@gmail.com`

      that represents a Google group.    For example, `admins@example.com`.

      users of that domain. For example, `google.com` or `example.com`.

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""Defines an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. It is used to
  specify access control policies for Cloud Platform resources.   A `Policy`
  consists of a list of `bindings`. A `binding` binds a list of `members` to a
  `role`, where the members can be user accounts, Google groups, Google
  domains, and service accounts. A `role` is a named list of permissions
  defined by IAM.  **JSON Example**      {       "bindings": [         {
  "role": "roles/owner",           "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com",             "group:admins@example.com",
  "domain:google.com",             "serviceAccount:my-other-
  app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"           ]         },         {
  "role": "roles/viewer",           "members": ["user:sean@example.com"]
  }       ]     }  **YAML Example**      bindings:     - members:       -
  user:mike@example.com       - group:admins@example.com       -
  domain:google.com       - serviceAccount:my-other-
  app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com       role: roles/owner     - members:

  and its features, see the [IAM developer's
  guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs).

  Fields:
    bindings: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. `bindings` with no
      members will result in an error.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy.  If no `etag` is provided in the call to `setIamPolicy`, then
      the existing policy is overwritten blindly.
    version: Deprecated.
