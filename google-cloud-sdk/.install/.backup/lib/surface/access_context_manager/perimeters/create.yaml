          For a *regular* service perimeter, these parameters specify the services
          to which the perimeter boundary applies. Only one may be provided, and
          the other is implicitly provided as a wildcard (```*```) matching
          all other services. For instance, `--restricted-services
          storage.googleapis.com` applies the perimeter boundary to the Google
          Cloud Storage service, but *not* any other services.

        Comma-separated list of IDs for access levels (in the same policy)
        that an intra-perimeter request must satisfy to be allowed.

          Allows resources within this service perimeter to import and export
          data amongst themselves.

          A project may belong to at most one regular service perimeter.
      - arg_value: bridge
        enum_value: PERIMETER_TYPE_BRIDGE
        help_text: |
          Allows resources in different regular service perimeters to import
          and export data between each other.

          A project may belong to multiple bridge service perimeters (only if
          it also belongs to a regular service perimeter). Both restricted and
          unrestricted service lists, as well as access level lists,
          must be empty.
